# ManualDependencyInjection


I made this to make dependency injection easier to understand

Its all with concrete classes, but you could build it with interfaces using the same principles to make it testable

Then you could swap out the arguments in the constructors with test mocks

start with the `me.jameshunt.m` package, and once you understand how they are connected, then go look in the `me.jameshunt.di` package
