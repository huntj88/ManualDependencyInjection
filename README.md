# ManualDependencyInjection


i made this to make dependency injection easier to understand
its all with concrete classes, but you could build it with interfaces using the same principles to make it testable

cause then you could swap out the arguments in the constructor with test mocks
but everywhere since everything is injected via DI
start with the `me.jameshunt.m` package, and once you understand how they are connected, then go look in the `me.jameshunt.di` package
